## About the Project
In this project, we created an application that helps inexperienced investors to learn investing without risking their hard earned money. To be able to use the app, a user has to sign up first. Up on sign up, a user will be given $10,000 fake free money that can be used to buy shares. A user will have access to the latest business news to be able to make decision of buying or selling. A user also can search companies by name to be able to get detailed information about the company a user would wish to search. If a user wouldn't like to buy, he/she will be given an option to put the company under a watch list. Any company under a watchlist can be removed when a user wishes to do so.

For each purchased share, the app shows current price, todays share price movement in graph and the gain or loss of money from owning that share.

The app also displays, total money a user has from owning shares. The trend for the combined investin money is also displayed for different time spans.
